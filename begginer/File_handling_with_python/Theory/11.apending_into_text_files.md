Since we know that if we open a file using write mod it is going to overwrite all the previous records files

So we have appending mode which helps us to retain the previous data while allowing us to add newer data into.

If a file doesnot exist by itself , the append mode will create a new one for us with the same name.

S.No        Name            Syntax                          Description

1. write()         <filehandle>.write(str1)        appends string str1 to file referenced by <filehandle>
1. writelines()    <filehandle>.writelines(L)      appends all strings in list L as lines to file referenced by <filehandle>
