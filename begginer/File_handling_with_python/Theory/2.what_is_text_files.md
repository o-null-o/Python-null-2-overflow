Text files are those files which store information in the form fof ASCII or UNICODE characters (the one which is default for your programming platform).

In text files,each line of text is terminated,(delmitted) with a special character know as EOL(End of line) characters.

In text files, some internal translations take place when this EOl character is read or written.

In python,by default, this EOL character is the newline character('\s') or carriage-return, newline combination('\r\s')
