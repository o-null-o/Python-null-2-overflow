A binary file is just a file that contains informaiton in the same format in which the information is held in memory,i.e,the file comtent that is retuned to you is raw (with no translation or specific encoding). In binary file, there is no delimiter for a line. Also no translatoins occur in binary files. As long as the file doesn't need to be read by people or need to be ported to a different type of system, binary files are the best way to store program information.
