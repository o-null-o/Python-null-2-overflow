In order to manipulate or create a file we have to open a file first ....

The basic purpose of opening a file is ....

`	`•Reading data from files

`	`•Writing data to files

`	`•Appending data to files

How to open file:-

`	`Syntax :=

`		`<file\_objectname>=open(<filename>)

`		`<file\_objectname>=open(<filename>,<modes>)

`	`•Here the open() function creates a file object which serves as a link to a file residing on you computer

`	`•The first parameterfior the open() function is a path to the file you'd like to open . If just the file name is given, then Python searches for the file in the current folder.

`	`•The second parameter opens the file in specific file mods which has specific works to do......

`	`example:=

`		`file1=open(r'today.txt')

`		`file2=open('mywork\\file\\maint.txt','r')

`	`•The above systex will create a file object named file1 and file2

`	`•The 'r' represents the raw string in python which is used as (r'today.txt')

`	`•In 'mywork\\file\\maint.txt','r' the double backslashes represent escape character for backslash for the file paths.........
